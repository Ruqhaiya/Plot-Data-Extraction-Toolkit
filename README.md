# Figure Data Extraction Toolkit

> Extract, clean, and re-plot numerical data from figures published in research papers—so you can finally put those JPEGs to work in your analyses.

## Project Overview

Research papers are full of valuable data locked inside static figures for which data is sometimes not publically published. This toolkit uses WebPlotDigitizer (automeris.io) and Python to:

- **Calibrate** chart axes with precision
- **Extract** raw data points (manually or via template matching)
- **Store** extraction sessions for easy re-calibration
- **Save** cleaned data as CSVs
- **Re-plot** against the original figure for verification

Whether you’re reproducing published results or building your own meta-analysis, this repo makes figure→data friction a thing of the past.

## Tech Stack

- **[WebPlotDigitizer](http://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/)** for interactive digitization  
- **Python 3.8+** with:
  - pandas  
  - matplotlib  
  - numpy  

## Repository Structure

> **Naming convention:** `<page>_<plot_label>.csv` (e.g. `40_B.csv`).

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/figure-data-extraction.git
   cd figure-data-extraction
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open a notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

   * Launch **re-plotting.ipynb** to see side-by-side comparisons.
   * Tweak **automeris\_projects\_each\_plot/** files and re-run extraction anytime.

## Typical Workflow

1. **Calibrate axes** in WebPlotDigitizer (set X1, X2, Y1, Y2).
2. **Extract points**

   * Manual clicking
   * Or “Template Matching” + clean-up
3. **Export**:

   * `.csv` for numbers
   * `.tar` project file for future edits
4. **Re-plot** using provided scripts/notebooks
5. **Validate**: visually confirm accuracy against original image

## Key Highlights

* **Reproducibility:** Store full digitizer projects to revisit and refine extractions.
* **Automation-Friendly:** Bulk-process dozens of figures with a single Python script.
* **Transparent:** Visual checks built into notebooks to ensure data integrity.
* **Skill Showcase:** Demonstrates proficiency in open-source tools, Python scripting, and data wrangling.

## Future Improvements

* Add CLI interface for headless batch extraction
* Integrate unit tests for calibration accuracy
* Package as a PyPI module
